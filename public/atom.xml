    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/16071562556" title="LunaPro-4 by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7487/16071562556_1bd134f99e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="LunaPro-4"></a></p>

<p>The Luna Pro is both Calfee&rsquo;s least expensive and most durable frame. Few, if any other bicycle manufacturer makes a carbon coupled bicycle. However, the advantages of low modulus carbon weaves paired with more carbon material allow Calfee to freely couple this bike together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15911593407" title="LunaPro-7 by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7463/15911593407_62561f57eb.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="LunaPro-7"></a></p>

<p>Most bicycle consumers associate lower modulus carbon with lower quality. This is far from the truth. Yes, you have to use more carbon (and thus gain more weight) with a lower modulus frame. But this adds value to the frame in terms of feel. The Luna Pro can only be described as &ldquo;steel-like&rdquo; in feel. The springy nature of having so much extra material between you and the road give it a dampening affect unlike nothing that comes out of Taiwain.</p>

<p>The S&amp;S couplers, though expensive, serve their purpose. Built to be both strong and light, they&rsquo;re manufactured out of titanium and add minimal weight to the rig. Paired with cable couplers to easy break down they make simple the process of getting your bike into tight spaces or tight cases.</p>

<p>And yes, the S&amp;S case is 64<sup>3</sup>, so it&rsquo;s airline ready.</p>

<p>The attention to detail in regards to paint on this bike is bar setting. I admitedly was afraid to case this bike up for travel when I first got it. With amble use of S&amp;S frame covers I was able to safely get it in the case damage-free each time. There was not a single blem to speak of when I first received this bike. Even though Calfee&rsquo;s in house paint is some of the best in the industry, you&rsquo;ll still find (if you look closely enough) a bubble here or there. That wasn&rsquo;t the case on this rig.</p>

<p>Even the decals had a blue highlight around the yellow, and in no areas was there a blur or blem. Absolutely amazing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15909917508" title="LunaPro-3 by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7577/15909917508_7713dc1d26.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="LunaPro-3"></a></p>

<p>The rear triangle has room for 28c tires. I rode this bike in the worst of conditions and never had issues with clearence. This speaks well of Calfee&rsquo;s conservative house geometry. This bike was completely off-the-shelf in terms of geometry and I was happy to see sensible design mixed with agressive, more race-like features such as a slightly steeper head tube. The latter makes up for any slow handling lost in the longer stays, as you get out of the saddle and can feel the bicycle on your hands and in the corners while descending.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the moon when I made the descision to build this bike. In hind-sight however, I&rsquo;m thouroughly impressed. I&rsquo;m no weight weenie but I thought this bike was just going to be too heavy. I was more than happy with the added benefits of more material as you don&rsquo;t always get to find (or want to) the smoothest tarmac when you&rsquo;re out traveling. This rig handles its share of beat up pavement and even a mix of single track here and there to piece the rides together.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/16093753491" title="calfee-7 by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7524/16093753491_10b24235aa.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="calfee-7"></a></p>

<p>The Calfee Dragonfly. Made of 66msi carbon fiber tubes (from Enve) and hand scultped lugs, this bicycle is the natural evolution of the Tetra. Bridging a fine line between stiffness and comfort, the Dragonfly epitomizes the tight handling of a race bicycle with all day comfort afforded by only the best endurance bikes around.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15908269678" title="10517307_10101349760041918_4605050698348999249_o by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7513/15908269678_569149ffaf.jpg" width="334" height="500" alt="10517307_10101349760041918_4605050698348999249_o"></a></p>

<p>The Dragonfly was the very first bicycle I purchased from Craig in 2011. A good friend of mine lent me his to test ride one day and I was hooked. I had been riding a Ridley Noah that season and though that bike was amazingly stiff it beat up my 135lb frame over the rough California roads that I sought on long weekend training rides. I wanted a bike that matched the finely tuned front end of a race bike with the out of the saddle acceleration afforded by short chainstays but paired with the ultimate forgiveness of a modern endurance bicycle.</p>

<p>The end result of this search was a Dragonfly frame with custom geometry. The chainstays came out so short in fact that Craig had to hand sand the inside of the rear wheel well around the bottom bracket to fit a 25c tire.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15908269758" title="10497961_10101349759837328_8636262039140927464_o by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7559/15908269758_85208b9189.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="10497961_10101349759837328_8636262039140927464_o"></a></p>

<p>The effort was not misplaced however, on my very first ride up Eureka Canyan I discovered the intuition behind the ultra short chain stays to be one of a kind. As a natural climber, the short chain stays felt like magic under my feet every time I got out of the saddle. Offering me insanely fast accelleration on every standing pedal stroke.</p>

<p>From the front of the bike to the back, every piece was built with efficiency and utilitarian yet modern comforts.</p>

<p>In the cockpit we went with 3T Ergonova bars paired to an Enve stem. Wrapped together in the stylistic BarStem that is symbolic of Craig&rsquo;s bicycles, this is by far the most comfortable cockpit I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to ride.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15909610269" title="10448534_10101349759892218_2612974266057909800_o by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7554/15909610269_fbe9d9d486.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="10448534_10101349759892218_2612974266057909800_o"></a>e</p>

<p>The drivetrain is 100% Shimano Di2. Criag removes all the cable bossings and is in fact the inventor of the Di2 battery seatpost. Shimano bought this patent from Craig in 2013 so they could mass produce it. Craig takes the advantages of &lsquo;fly-by-the-wire&rsquo; shifting to its ultimate conclusion by internally routing all wires, cable harnesses and even the junction box (which he not places in the steer tube or stem depending on the build). The &lsquo;ultra-clean frontend&rsquo; is a beautiful way of integrating the Di2 parts with the rest of the bicycle, ensuring only promotion of the bicycle aesthetic.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was going to stick with the Di2, so we didn&rsquo;t fully integrate the junction box into the front of the bicycle. I instead opted to epoxy it to the underside of my BarStem, allowing me the option of going with another grouppo down the road, or doing the full intgration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15909946307" title="10504885_10101349759942118_8614849752771244170_o by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8636/15909946307_7fbf3e7660.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="10504885_10101349759942118_8614849752771244170_o"></a></p>

<p>Craig also integrates several types of Garmin computer mounts with the BarStem combo. Giving the front end of the bike even more continuity and less clutter. I opted for a K-Edge metal mount to accent the Di2 components.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129457394@N03/15909946347" title="10547801_10101349759687628_1792516859953673658_o by Jeff Malnick, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8627/15909946347_7360c02833.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="10547801_10101349759687628_1792516859953673658_o"></a></p>

<p>The paint on this Dragonfly was done 100% in house. Clear coat around the lugs, giving them that popping look and further promoting what is probably the most distinctive part of any of Craigs bicks, the lugs. Paired that with negative space, reversed paint/clear coat decals on the inside of the fork legs and chain stays to give it an agressive, eye catching design. We had several iterations of &ldquo;pink&rdquo; leading up to this final color decision. In person, it&rsquo;s more metallic than the photos make it out to be. It gets hotter in daylight and more purple in the shadows.</p>

<p>Calfee&rsquo;s in house paint department has really upped their game in the last two years. I&rsquo;m thourghly impressed and it really is something that has to be seen in person to be fully appreciated.</p>
