The Calfee Dragonfly. Made of 66msi carbon fiber tubes (from Enve) and hand scultped lugs, this bicycle is the natural evolution of the Tetra. Bridging a fine line between stiffness and comfort, the Dragonfly epitomizes the tight handling of a race bicycle with all day comfort afforded by only the best endurance bikes around.

The Dragonfly was the very first bicycle I purchased from Craig in 2011. A good friend of mine lent me his to test ride one day and I was hooked. I had been riding a Ridley Noah that season and though that bike was amazingly stiff it beat up my 135lb frame over the rough California roads that I sought on long weekend training rides. I wanted a bike that matched the finely tuned front end of a race bike with the out of the saddle acceleration afforded by short chainstays but paired with the ultimate forgiveness of a modern endurance bicycle.

The end result of this search was a Dragonfly frame with custom geometry. The chainstays came out so short in fact that Craig had to hand sand the inside of the rear wheel well around the bottom bracket to fit a 25c tire.

The effort was not misplaced however, on my very first ride up Eureka Canyan I discovered the intuition behind the ultra short chain stays to be one of a kind. As a natural climber, the short chain stays felt like magic under my feet every time I got out of the saddle. Offering me insanely fast accelleration on every standing pedal stroke. 

From the front of the bike to the back, every piece was built with efficiency and utilitarian yet modern comforts. 

In the cockpit we went with 3T Ergonova bars paired to an Enve stem. Wrapped together in the stylistic BarStem that is symbolic of Craig's bicycles, this is by far the most comfortable cockpit I've had the opportunity to ride.

The drivetrain is 100% Shimano Di2. Criag removes all the cable bossings and is in fact the inventor of the Di2 battery seatpost. Shimano bought this patent from Craig in 2013 so they could mass produce it. Craig takes the advantages of 'fly-by-the-wire' shifting to its ultimate conclusion by internally routing all wires, cable harnesses and even the junction box (which he not places in the steer tube or stem depending on the build). The 'ultra-clean frontend' is a beautiful way of integrating the Di2 parts with the rest of the bicycle, ensuring only promotion of the bicycle aesthetic.

I wasn't sure I was going to stick with the Di2, so we didn't fully integrate the junction box into the front of the bicycle. I instead opted to epoxy it to the underside of my BarStem, allowing me the option of going with another grouppo down the road, or doing the full intgration.

Craig also integrates several types of Garmin computer mounts with the BarStem combo. Giving the front end of the bike even more continuity and less clutter. I opted for a K-Edge metal mount to accent the Di2 components.

The paint on this Dragonfly was done 100% in house. Clear coat around the lugs, giving them that popping look and further promoting what is probably the most distinctive part of any of Craigs bicks, the lugs. Paired that with negative space, reversed paint/clear coat decals on the inside of the fork legs and chain stays to give it an agressive, eye catching design. We had several iterations of "pink" leading up to this final color decision. In person, it's more metallic than the photos make it out to be. It gets hotter in daylight and more purple in the shadows. 

Calfee's in house paint department has really upped their game in the last two years. I'm thourghly impressed and it really is something that has to be seen in person to be fully appreciated.
