The Luna Pro is both Calfee's least expensive and most durable frame. Few, if any other bicycle manufacturer makes a carbon coupled bicycle. However, the advantages of low modulus carbon weaves paired with more carbon material allow Calfee to freely couple this bike together.

Most bicycle consumers associate lower modulus carbon with lower quality. This is far from the truth. Yes, you have to use more carbon (and thus gain more weight) with a lower modulus frame. But this adds value to the frame in terms of feel. The Luna Pro can only be described as "steel-like" in feel. The springy nature of having so much extra material between you and the road give it a dampening affect unlike nothing that comes out of Taiwain.

The S&S couplers, though expensive, serve their purpose. Built to be both strong and light, they're manufactured out of titanium and add minimal weight to the rig. Paired with cable couplers to easy break down they make simple the process of getting your bike into tight spaces or tight cases.

And yes, the S&S case is 64^3, so it's airline ready.

The attention to detail in regards to paint on this bike is bar setting. I admitedly was afraid to case this bike up for travel when I first got it. With amble use of S&S frame covers I was able to safely get it in the case damage-free each time. There was not a single blem to speak of when I first received this bike. Even though Calfee's in house paint is some of the best in the industry, you'll still find (if you look closely enough) a bubble here or there. That wasn't the case on this rig.

Even the decals had a blue highlight around the yellow, and in no areas was there a blur or blem. Absolutely amazing.

The rear triangle has room for 28c tires. I rode this bike in the worst of conditions and never had issues with clearence. This speaks well of Calfee's conservative house geometry. This bike was completely off-the-shelf in terms of geometry and I was happy to see sensible design mixed with agressive, more race-like features such as a slightly steeper head tube. The latter makes up for any slow handling lost in the longer stays, as you get out of the saddle and can feel the bicycle on your hands and in the corners while descending.

I wasn't expecting the moon when I made the descision to build this bike. In hind-sight however, I'm thouroughly impressed. I'm no weight weenie but I thought this bike was just going to be too heavy. I was more than happy with the added benefits of more material as you don't always get to find (or want to) the smoothest tarmac when you're out traveling. This rig handles its share of beat up pavement and even a mix of single track here and there to piece the rides together.
