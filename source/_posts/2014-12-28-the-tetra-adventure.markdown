A bicycle is designed to take you anywhere you want to go. However, most road bikes lake neccessary clearence for tires, demanding brakes, and customizations to really do that and do it well.

Adventure bikes are Craig's answer to the demanding application of the do-it-all and do-it-right attitude that bicycles **should** epitomize. You can get every road frame that Craig produces in adventure geometry. This allows you to choose the mixture of durability, feel and price to suite your needs.

Let's be clear: this isn't a cross bike. I've owned several cross bikes. My favorite was my Ibis Hakkalugi. Scot Nicholes and team at Ibis did an incredible job re-making this brand, and the beloved hand job rear brake bossing. However, outside of the tight turns, mud filled revenes and Belgian stairs of the cross course I wasn't happy. I wanted a rig that felt comfortable on long paved rides to the dirt; a rig that held it's own on the occassional single track connector; a rig that didn't hurt my hands from death gripping the cantaleiver brakes on long, wash board descents.

This adventure rigs base is the Tetra frameset. The Tetra frameset goes way back to 1996, when Calfee Design was called Carbonframes. The Tetra Pro and Tetra Tri framesets share a striking similarity yet modern feel to the frame Greg LeMond rode in the 1991 tour up Alpe dâ€™Huez and into the leader's jersey. This time-proven masterpiece has been refined to it's current inception in 25 years of iteration. It is the oldest continually produced carbon bicycle design in the world.

The success of this frame set is not mis guided. The design, originally carried out in 1987, was so sturdy that the Tetra carries with it a 25 year warranty. What was that warranty on your new monocaque frame? 1 year? 6 months? And the frame cracked at the seat collar after 13 months? Bummer.

Wrapping the tubes at the joints produces a far greater fatigue life than that of adhesive bonds. The Tetra's wrapped joints has a unique look among Calfee's stable, but still shares the sexy, Calfee-inspired modlded edges that its lugged counterparts have.
